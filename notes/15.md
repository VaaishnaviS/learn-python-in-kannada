### **Introduction to OOP Concepts & Classes/Objects**

In this video, we will begin our journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with the foundational concepts of classes and objects.

### **1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

- **OOP** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
- It allows for better modularity and code reusability by creating objects that model real-world entities.

#### **Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming**:
- **Procedural Programming**: Based on functions, where the main focus is on performing actions.
  - Example: Writing multiple functions to process data.
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Based on objects and classes. The main focus is on objects (data) and the methods (functions) that manipulate this data.

### **2. Classes and Objects**

#### **Class**:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors of the objects created from it.

#### **Object**:
An object is an instance of a class. Each object has its own attributes (data) and can perform actions through methods (functions).

#### **Example**:
```python
class Car:
    # Attributes
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand  # Instance variable
        self.model = model  # Instance variable

    # Method
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}")

# Creating an object of the class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.display_info()
```

**Output**:
```
Car Brand: Toyota, Model: Corolla
```

Here:
- `Car` is the class.
- `my_car` is an object of the `Car` class.
- `brand` and `model` are attributes of the object.
- `display_info()` is a method that displays the car's details.

---

### **3. Attributes (Instance Variables) and Methods**

- **Attributes**: Characteristics that define an object. For example, in the `Car` class, `brand` and `model` are attributes.
- **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.

#### **Example**:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Creating objects
person1 = Person("Arjun", 30)
person2 = Person("Megha", 25)

person1.greet()
person2.greet()
```

**Output**:
```
Hello, my name is Arjun and I am 30 years old.
Hello, my name is Megha and I am 25 years old.
```

In this example:
- The `Person` class defines two attributes: `name` and `age`.
- The method `greet()` prints a greeting message using these attributes.

---

### **4. Creating Multiple Objects from a Class**

One of the main advantages of OOP is that you can create multiple objects from a class, each with its own unique attributes.

#### **Example**:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is barking!")

# Creating multiple objects
dog1 = Dog("Rex", "Golden Retriever")
dog2 = Dog("Bolt", "Beagle")

dog1.bark()
dog2.bark()
```

**Output**:
```
Rex is barking!
Bolt is barking!
```

Here:
- `dog1` and `dog2` are different objects of the `Dog` class, each with its own `name` and `breed`.

---

### **5. Homework**

1. **Create a Class**:
   - Write a class `Mobile` with attributes `brand` and `price`.
   - Create two objects of the class and display their attributes using a method.

2. **Method Definition**:
   - Define a class `Student` with attributes `name` and `marks`.
   - Write a method `display_info()` that prints the student's name and marks.
   - Create multiple objects of the `Student` class and call the method on each.
