# **Getters, Setters, Method Overloading & Overriding, super(), Abstract Classes**


### **1. Getters and Setters**

- **Definition**: Getters and setters are methods that allow controlled access to an object's attributes.
- **Purpose**: They help in validating data, protecting data from accidental modification, and providing controlled access.

#### **Example**:
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age  # Private attribute

    # Getter for age
    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age

    # Setter for age
    def set_age(self, age):
        if age > 0:  # Validation
            self.__age = age
        else:
            print("Invalid age")

# Usage
student = Student("Anita", 20)
print("Age:", student.get_age())  # Accessing age with getter
student.set_age(21)  # Modifying age with setter
print("Updated Age:", student.get_age())
```

**Output**:
```
Age: 20
Updated Age: 21
```

Here:
- `get_age()` provides read-only access to `__age`, while `set_age()` enables controlled modification.

### **2. Method Overloading**

- **Definition**: Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. 
- **Note**: Python doesn’t support method overloading directly, but we can achieve it by using default parameters or by handling varying numbers of arguments with `*args` or `**kwargs`.

#### **Example**:
```python
class MathOperations:
    def add(self, a, b, c=0):
        return a + b + c  # Handles both 2 and 3 parameter cases

# Usage
math = MathOperations()
print(math.add(5, 10))     # Two arguments
print(math.add(5, 10, 15)) # Three arguments
```

**Output**:
```
15
30
```

Here:
- The method `add` can accept either two or three arguments, handling both cases within the same method.

---

### **3. Method Overriding**

- **Definition**: Method overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.
- **Purpose**: It enables a child class to alter or extend the behavior of a parent class method.

#### **Example**:
```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("This animal makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")  # Overrides the parent class method

# Usage
animal = Animal()
animal.sound()
dog = Dog()
dog.sound()  # Calls the overridden method in Dog class
```

**Output**:
```
This animal makes a sound
Dog barks
```

Here:
- `sound()` in `Dog` overrides the `sound()` method in `Animal`, providing specific behavior for `Dog`.

---

### **4. `super()` Function**

- **Definition**: The `super()` function is used in child classes to call a method from the parent class, enabling access to inherited methods or attributes.
- **Purpose**: It ensures that the parent class's method is executed alongside any additional functionality added in the child class, useful when overriding methods but still needing to incorporate the parent’s behavior.

#### **Example**:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def sound(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)  # Calling the parent class's __init__ method
        self.breed = breed

    def sound(self):
        super().sound()  # Calling the parent class's sound method
        print(f"{self.name} barks")

# Usage
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Labrador")
dog.sound()
```

**Output**:
```
Buddy makes a sound
Buddy barks
```

Here:
- `super().__init__(name)` in the `Dog` class calls the `__init__` method from the `Animal` class, initializing the `name` attribute.
- Similarly, `super().sound()` calls the `sound` method in `Animal`, followed by the additional behavior in `Dog`.

### **5. Abstract Classes**

- **Definition**: An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It can have abstract methods, which must be implemented by subclasses.
- **Purpose**: Abstract classes provide a blueprint for other classes, enforcing a structure where subclasses must implement certain methods.
- **Implementation**: Use the `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) module to create abstract classes in Python.

#### **Example**:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):  # Abstract base class
    @abstractmethod
    def start_engine(self):
        pass  # Abstract method with no implementation

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Car engine started")

# Usage
car = Car()
car.start_engine()
```

**Output**:
```
Car engine started
```

Here:
- `Vehicle` is an abstract class that defines an abstract method `start_engine()`. 
- `Car` inherits from `Vehicle` and provides an implementation of `start_engine()`, enabling us to create an object of `Car`.

### **6. Homework**

1. **Getters and Setters**:
   - Create a class `BankAccount` with a private attribute `balance`.
   - Write a getter method to retrieve the balance and a setter method to update it, ensuring the balance never goes below zero.

2. **Method Overloading**:
   - Write a class `Calculator` with a method `multiply()`. Allow it to take either two or three arguments to multiply two or three numbers.

3. **Method Overriding**:
   - Create a parent class `Shape` with a method `draw()` that prints "Drawing shape".
   - Create a child class `Circle` that overrides `draw()` to print "Drawing circle".

4. **Abstract Classes**:
   - Define an abstract class `Employee` with an abstract method `calculate_salary()`.
   - Create a subclass `Manager` that implements `calculate_salary()` based on working hours and rate per hour.
