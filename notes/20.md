# OOP Challenges

### **1. Banking System Simulation**
Design a system to simulate a bank's operations, where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balance.  
- Extend functionality to include multiple account types (e.g., savings, current) with unique behaviors like interest calculation or overdraft limits.
- Emphasize encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

### **2. Library Management System**
Create a library system that keeps track of books, borrowers, and availability. Allow borrowing, returning, and viewing available books.
- Include due dates, penalties for late returns, and unique IDs for books and users.
- Focus on class relationships and method responsibilities.

### **3. Hospital Patient Management**
Create a hospital management system that tracks doctors, patients, and appointments.  
- Doctors can have specialties, and patients may have different ailments.
- Each appointment should store the doctor-patient relationship, along with the date and time.
- Add functionality for doctors' schedules and ensuring no double booking.

### **4. E-Commerce Platform Prototype**
Simulate a basic e-commerce platform where customers can browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders.  
- Use OOP principles to manage inventory, pricing (e.g., discounts), and order tracking.
- Integrate functionality for calculating taxes and shipping costs dynamically.

### **5. Student Report Card Generator**
Build a system that collects student data and subject-wise marks to generate a report card.
- Include grade calculation, average score, and pass/fail result.
- Use encapsulation for mark storage and method abstraction for result generation.

These challenges progressively test the understanding of core OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation, while also encouraging real-world problem-solving.
