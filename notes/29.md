# Iterators and Generators in Python


## 1. What is an Iterator?

* An **iterator** is an object that allows you to traverse through a sequence (like list, tuple, string) **one element at a time**.
* Behind the scenes, Python uses two special methods:

  * `__iter__()` â†’ returns the iterator object.
  * `__next__()` â†’ returns the next item from the sequence.

ðŸ“Œ **Example 1: Iterating a list**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

# Get iterator from list
it = iter(numbers)

print(next(it))  # 1
print(next(it))  # 2
print(next(it))  # 3
# print(next(it))  # Raises StopIteration
```

âš¡ Important:
When there are no more items, Python raises a **StopIteration** error.

---

## 2. Using Iterators with Loops

* Normally, we donâ€™t call `next()` manually.
* Pythonâ€™s **for loop** internally uses iterators.

ðŸ“Œ **Example 2:**

```python
for num in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(num)
```

âž¡ This does the same thing as creating an iterator and calling `next()` repeatedly.

---

## 3. Creating Your Own Iterator

You can define your own class and implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.

ðŸ“Œ **Example 3: Custom Iterator**

```python
class CountDown:
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.start = start
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.start <= 0:
            raise StopIteration
        num = self.start
        self.start -= 1
        return num

cd = CountDown(5)

for i in cd:
    print(i)
```

âœ… Output:

```
5
4
3
2
1
```

---

## 4. Generators in Python

* Writing iterators manually can be **complex**.
* Python provides **generators** to make this easy.
* A **generator** is a function that uses the keyword **`yield`** instead of `return`.

ðŸ“Œ **Example 4: Generator Function**

```python
def simple_gen():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

gen = simple_gen()
print(next(gen))  # 1
print(next(gen))  # 2
print(next(gen))  # 3
```

âž¡ Each time `yield` is hit, the function **pauses** and saves its state, resuming when `next()` is called again.

---

## 5. Generators with Loops

* Generators are often used with `for` loops.

ðŸ“Œ **Example 5:**

```python
def squares(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * i

for val in squares(5):
    print(val)
```

âœ… Output:

```
0
1
4
9
16
```

---

## 6. Generator Expressions

* Like list comprehensions, but use `()` instead of `[]`.
* They are **memory-efficient** because values are generated on the fly.

ðŸ“Œ **Example 6:**

```python
gen_exp = (x*x for x in range(5))
print(next(gen_exp))  # 0
print(next(gen_exp))  # 1
print(list(gen_exp))  # [4, 9, 16]
```

## 7. Difference Between Iterators and Generators

| Feature        | Iterators (Custom Class)             | Generators (`yield`)           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Implementation | Need to write `__iter__`, `__next__` | Just use `yield` in a function |
| Memory Usage   | Can be heavy (store state manually)  | Very memory efficient          |
| Ease of Use    | Verbose, more code                   | Very concise                   |
| Example        | Countdown class                      | `squares(n)` function          |

---

## 8. Real-Life Use Cases

* **Large data processing** (files, logs, streaming data).
* **Pipelines** (processing one item at a time).
* **Infinite sequences** (e.g., Fibonacci, natural numbers).

ðŸ“Œ **Example 7: Infinite Generator**

```python
def infinite_numbers():
    num = 1
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1

gen = infinite_numbers()
for i in range(5):
    print(next(gen))
```

âœ… Output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

---

# âœ¨ Summary

* **Iterators** = objects that follow `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.
* **Generators** = simple way to create iterators using `yield`.
* **Generator expressions** = memory-efficient, on-demand sequences.
* Very useful in handling **large datasets**, **streams**, and **infinite sequences**.
